<h2>"QuickNav"</h2>This website offers a streamlined personal bookmarking experience.
It features a modern design with a dynamic background image that anchors the visual appeal.
Interactive glassmorphism buttons provide a sleek way to access 
various links. The headings are styled with contemporary fonts
and subtle glow effects, enhancing readability and overall aesthetics.
While sound effects are implemented for button interactions,
they require an initial user click to comply with browser autoplay policies.
